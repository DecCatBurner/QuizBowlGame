This project plans to gamify the quiz bowl studying experience for any and all.

1.To open the project, go to the releases, lastest release, downloads. 

2.Then, download the source code (zip) and extract the files.
Finally, go to bin, Debug, net 7.0, and open the application (QuizBowlTextGame).

2a.Alternatively, some releases will have a release folder (zip) that you will simply download, extract, and run the application.

3.Now, once one opens the application they will need to give permission to the application.
Click 'More Info' and then allow the application to run anyways.
